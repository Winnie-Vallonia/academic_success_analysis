# Student Performance Factors Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the "Student Performance Factors" dataset, focusing on understanding various factors affecting student performance in exams. The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1- How does the number of hours studied affect exam scores?
This question aims to examine whether thereâ€™s a measurable correlation between study hours and performance, exploring the potential benefits of increased study time.

2- How do study habits correlate with student performance?
Beyond study hours, this question investigates how habits such as sleep, tutoring, and participation in extracurricular activities relate to exam scores.

3- Is there a relationship between attendance rates and exam scores?
This question seeks to understand the impact of class attendance on academic outcomes, helping to clarify the importance of regular classroom engagement.

4- What role does parental involvement play in academic success?
This analysis will examine how different levels of parental involvement contribute to or affect student performance.

5-How do demographic factors influence performance?
This includes analyzing the influence of factors like family income, parental education level, and access to resources, to determine their potential effects on academic achievement.

The project code and results will be contained in the Jupyter Notebook `student-performance-analysis.ipynb`, with a summary of conclusions to be provided below.
